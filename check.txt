iCloud:
  - icloud account reset in system settings (you’re able to perform a reset), match serial on box + laptop + apple website here https://checkcoverage.apple.com/
  - System Settings → Apple ID → iCloud → Find My Mac — should be OFF if they’ve signed out.
Test:
  - Wi-Fi
  - Bluetooth
  - speakers
  - camera
  - keyboard
  - trackpad.
Check display/screen carefully 
  - (if it has been replaced)  
  - for dead pixels
  - discoloration
  - flickering.
Physical condition:
  - Check bottom screws — stripped or mismatched screws can mean tampering.
  - Inspect for dents/scratches — even tiny ones reveal handling.
  - Open/close hinge — should be smooth, no squeaks or looseness.
  - Look at palm rest & trackpad for shine (wear).
  - Test all USB-C/USB/HDMI ports with real devices.
